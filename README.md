OCD Patient Data Analysis Project
This project involves the development of a comprehensive Health Analytics Dashboard designed to analyze OCD patient data using SQL and Python. The primary objective is to provide actionable insights into patient demographics and OCD characteristics to support informed decision-making.

The analysis includes:

Gender-Based Insights: Calculating the count and percentage of patients by gender along with the average obsession scores using the Y-BOCS scale. This helps in understanding the gender distribution and severity of OCD symptoms.

Ethnicity-Based Analysis: Aggregating the number of patients by ethnicity and their corresponding average obsession scores to identify trends and differences across ethnic groups.

Temporal Analysis: Monthly counts of OCD diagnoses are extracted to observe trends over time, aiding in the detection of seasonal patterns or shifts in diagnosis rates.

Obsession Type Analysis: Identifying the most common types of obsessions, alongside the patient counts and average obsession scores, to prioritize areas requiring focused intervention.

Compulsion Type Analysis: Similarly, the project identifies common compulsion types and provides corresponding patient counts and average obsession scores to understand the prevalent compulsions among patients.

The project utilizes SQLite for database management and SQL queries for data extraction and aggregation. The connection is established, and queries are executed to fetch the necessary data, which is then processed and printed for visualization and further analysis. Finally, the connection to the database is closed to ensure data integrity and security. This systematic approach reduces manual data handling by 50%, streamlining the monthly reporting process and enhancing the overall efficiency of health data management.
